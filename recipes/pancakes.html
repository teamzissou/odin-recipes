    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 &#189 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>teaspoons baking powder</li> 
        <li>&#188; teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 &#188; cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
